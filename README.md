# 👋 Hi, I'm Swathi Arasu! 

🔭 I’m a passionate **Data Science student and Product Innovator** with a strong foundation in **Generative AI (GenAI)** and **Machine Learning**, currently pursuing a **Master's in Data Science at Northeastern University**. With two years of experience as a Research Engineer in ML, I specialize in **Natural Language Processing, Predictive Modeling, and Applied Machine Learning**.

🌟 As an **Adobe Student Ambassador**, I collaborate with a global community of creators and innovators. I also have experience as a **Teaching Assistant** for course in **Data Mining Techniques** , where I guide students in mastering advanced data science concepts.

👩‍💻 I’m actively exploring:
- Reinforcement Learning and Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Real-world AI applications in Healthcare and Finance
- Advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP)
